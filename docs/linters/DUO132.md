# DUO132

This linter searches for insecure keyword argument use in the `urllib3` module.
Specifically, it looks for objects that may have HTTPS certification
verification disabled by setting `"NONE"`, `"CERT_NONE"`, `CERT_NONE`, or
`ssl.CERT_NONE` set for the `cert_reqs` keyward argument. These values disable
verification and thus allow for insecure HTTPS connections.

## Problematic code

```python
import urllib3
import ssl
from ssl import CERT_NONE

urllib3.PoolManager(cert_reqs="CERT_NONE")
urllib3.ProxyManager(cert_reqs="CERT_NONE")
urllib3.HTTPSConnectionPool(cert_reqs="NONE")
urllib3.connection_from_url(cert_reqs=ssl.CERT_NONE)
urllib3.proxy_from_url(cert_reqs=CERT_NONE)
```

## Correct code

Simply not specifying `cert_reqs` will default to secure behavior. Further,
setting `ssl.CERT_REQUIRED` or its variants will ensure verification is
performed.

## Rationale

HTTPS certificate verification ensures your requests are communicating with
whom they're supposed to be. Without this there could be an attacker
impersonating the server you intend to be communicating with. To prevent this
you must ensure certification verification is enabled.

## Exceptions

* Code connecting to internal network services (although these should strive for full HTTPS as well)
* Code connecting to local development services or in test environments
