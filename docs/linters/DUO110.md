# DUO110

This linter searches for use of the built-in `compile` function. This function
is commonly accompanied by `eval` or `exec` and thus could lead to arbitrary
code execution bugs. Further, a sufficiently large string passed to `compile`
can crash the Python interpreter.

## Problematic code

```python
malicious_input = 'open("/etc/passwd", "w").write("bad data")'
code = compile(malicious_input, '<compile>', 'exec')
exec(code)
```

```python
crash_interpreter = '+chr(33)' * 1000000
compile(crash_interpreter, '<compile>', 'eval')
```

## Correct code

Ensure data passed to `compile` contains no user input, or is a constant
string, and is limited to small strings.

## Rationale

Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the
context of the system the bug is found. E.g. open a reverse shell to a system
of their choosing, install malware by downloading and running a payload,
silently log actions performed on the victim system, etc.

Arbitrary code execution bugs are effectively the keys to the castle. We'd
like to avoid using the above function because it commonly allows for these
types of bugs.

Further, with a sufficiently large string a user could crash the Python
interpreter which may lead to denial-of-service (DoS) bugs.

## Exceptions

* Code may be safe if data passed to `compile` contains no user input and limits data size
* Code may be safe if data passed to `compile` is a constant string and limits data size
