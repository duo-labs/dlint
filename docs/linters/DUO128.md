# DUO128

This linter searches for insecure keyword argument use of the `onelogin` module.

The `onelogin` module provides [SAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_Assertion_Markup_Language)
functionality in a Python library. This linter searches for many insecure ways
of using the SAML protocol. This includes things like using SHA1 as a
fingerprint algorithm (as opposed to SHA256), SHA1 signatures used during
signing/validating, disabled validation, etc.

## Problematic code

Do to the number of behaviors this linter searches for it is recommended to
look at the [linter code itself](https://github.com/duo-labs/dlint/blob/master/dlint/linters/bad_onelogin_kwarg_use.py).

## Correct code

SAML is a notoriously difficult protocol to implement and use correctly. It is
not feasible to show a secure SAML implementation that fits many cases
generally.

Be sure that you're familiar with the `security` settings in the [How it Works](https://github.com/onelogin/python-saml#how-it-works)
section and common literature for securing this protocol:

* [The Beer Drinker's Guide to SAML](https://duo.com/blog/the-beer-drinkers-guide-to-saml)
* [How SAML Authentication Works](https://auth0.com/blog/how-saml-authentication-works/)
* [SAML Security Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SAML_Security_Cheat_Sheet.html)
* [On Breaking SAML: Be Whoever You Want to Be](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/usenixsecurity12/sec12-final91.pdf)

## Rationale

See above.

## Exceptions

* There will often be times when using the most secure options will not be
possible. For example, the SP or IDP you're communicating with does not support
the most secure configuration. In these situations the challenges may not be
completely technical ones and you may have to fallback on insecure (or at
least not *the most* secure) options - here you'll have to use your best
judgement.
