# DUO111

This linter searches for insecure use of the `sys` module.

Use of `call_tracing`, `setprofile`, or `settrace` can allow for
arbitrary code execution bugs.

## Problematic code

```python
import sys

sys.call_tracing(func, args)
sys.setprofile(func, args)
sys.settrace(func, args)
```

## Correct code

This functionality can correctly be used to debug code, but rarely, if ever,
should be used in production code.

## Rationale

Debuggers or code profilers will commonly use these functions, however,
attackers may use these functions to enable advanced persistent threats (APTs).
This can be achieved by smuggling code onto a victim's machine then
persistently calling it via the above functions.

For more information see [PEP 551](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0551/)
and [PEP 578](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0578/). More specifically,
PEP 578 calls out these functions as "Suggested Audit Hooks."

## Exceptions

* Debugging code in a development environment
* Code that is explicitly used as a debugger, profiler, etc
