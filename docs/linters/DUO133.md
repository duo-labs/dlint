# DUO133

This linter searches for use of the `Crypto` module.

The `Crypto` module is provided by the [`pycrypto`](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto)
library. This library is no longer maintained and has known vulnerabilities
and exploits ([dlitz/pycrypto#176](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/176),
[dlitz/pycrypto#253](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/253),
[dlitz/pycrypto#269](https://github.com/dlitz/pycrypto/issues/269)).

## Problematic code

```python
from Crypto.Cipher import AES

obj = AES.new('This is a key', AES.MODE_CBC, 'This is an IV')
message = 'One if by land, two if by sea'
ciphertext = obj.encrypt(message)
```

## Correct code

This is just an example, but if you really are trying to accomplish symmetric
key encryption then take a look at [Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/):

```python
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet

key = Fernet.generate_key()
fernet = Fernet(key)
message = b'One if by land, two if by sea'
token = fernet.encrypt(message)
```

To illustrate corrections to the above code:

```python
from cryptography.hazmat.primitives.ciphers import Cipher, algorithms, modes
from cryptography.hazmat.backends import default_backend

cipher = Cipher(
    algorithms.AES('This is a key'),
    modes.CBC('This is an IV'),
    backend=default_backend()
)
encryptor = cipher.encryptor()
message = b'One if by land, two if by sea'
ciphertext = encryptor.update(message) + encryptor.finalize()
```

```python
from Cryptodome.Cipher import AES

obj = AES.new('This is a key', AES.MODE_CBC, 'This is an IV')
message = 'One if by land, two if by sea'
ciphertext = obj.encrypt(message)
```

## Rationale

Using `pycrypto` is insecure for these reasons:

* The library is unmaintained - future bugs will not be fixed.
* There are known vulnerabilities along with working exploits.
* The library's API does not encourage safe-by-default, simple, obvious code.
Cryptography operations are notorious difficult, so working with a library
that prioritizes simplicity and safety should be preferred.

The `cryptography` library is considered best-practice in the Python community.
The `pycryptodomex` library should only be used when API-compatibility is
necessary and `cryptography` cannot be used. Note that `pycryptodomex` is
recommended over `pycryptodome` so Dlint can efficiently detect which library
is being used. Both `pycrypto` and `pycryptodome` use the `Crypto` module,
whereas `pycryptodomex` uses `Cryptodome`. This makes usage easier to detect.
