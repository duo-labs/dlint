# DUO120

This linter looks for use of the `marshal` module`.

From the documentation:

> The `marshal` module is not intended to be secure against erroneous
> or maliciously constructed data. Never unmarshal data received from an
> untrusted or unauthenticated source.

## Problematic code

```python
import marshal
```

## Correct code

Instead of using the `marshal` library it is preferable to use a serialization
format that does not allow for code execution, such as `json`.

## Rationale

Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the
context of the system the bug is found. E.g. open a reverse shell to a system
of their choosing, install malware by downloading and running a payload,
silently log actions performed on the victim system, etc.

Arbitrary code execution bugs are effectively the keys to the castle. We'd
like to avoid using the above function because it commonly allows for these
types of bugs.

## Exceptions

* Code may be safe if data passed to `marshal` contains no user input
* Code may be safe if data passed to `marshal` is a constant string
