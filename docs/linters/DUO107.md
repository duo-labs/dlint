# DUO107

This linter searches for use of the `lxml`, `xml`, `xmlrpclib` modules. These
libraries are not hardened against many common XML attacks. The `defusedxml`
library should be preferred to these modules.

## Problematic code

```python
from xml.etree.ElementTree import parse
et = parse(xmlfile)
```

## Correct code

```python
from defusedxml.ElementTree import parse
et = parse(xmlfile)
```

## Rationale

The XML data format is notoriously complex and provides many attack vectors.
Common Python XML libriaries are vulnerable to various attacks such as
exponential entity expansion, quadratic entity expansion, remote and local
external entity expansion, DTD retrieval, etc.

For more information on specific vulnerabilities see [Python XML Libraries](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/#python-xml-libraries).

## Exceptions

* The `xml.sax.saxutils` sub-module is safe to use
