# DUO102

This linter searches for `random` module use not using `random.SystemRandom`.
The `random` module is not suitable for security or cryptographic uses.

## Problematic code

```python
import random

browser_cookie = random.randint(min_value, max_value)
```

## Correct code

```python
from random import SystemRandom
safe_random = SystemRandom()

browser_cookie = safe_random.randint(min_value, max_value)
```

When using Python 3.6+ it is also advisable to use the `secrets` module.

## Rationale

Python uses the Mersenne Twister as the core generator. However, being
completely deterministic, it is not suitable for all purposes, and is
completely unsuitable for cryptographic purposes. Because the generator is
deterministic this means attackers can predict future values given a
sufficient amount of previous values.

## Exceptions

* Normal `random` use is acceptable if the relevant code is not used for security or cryptographic purposes
