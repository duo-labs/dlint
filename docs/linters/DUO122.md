# DUO122

This linter looks for unsafe use of the Python `ssl` module.

Making secure HTTPS connections is a notoriously difficult task filled with
many non-obvious gotchas. This linter performs basic sanity checks on various
common mistakes.

## Problematic code

```python
import ssl

ssl._https_verify_certificates(enable=False)
```

```python
import ssl
import urllib

context = ssl._create_unverified_context()
urllib.urlopen("https://insecure-website", context=context)
```

```python
import ssl
import urllib

context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3)
urllib.urlopen("https://insecure-website", context=context)
```

```python
import ssl
import urllib

context = ssl.SSLContext(ssl.PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2)
context.verify_mode = ssl.CERT_NONE
urllib.urlopen("https://insecure-website", context=context)
```

## Correct code

```python
import ssl
import urllib

context = ssl.create_default_context()
urllib.urlopen("https://secure-website", context=context)
```

## Rationale

For more information see [`ssl` security considerations](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ssl.html#ssl-security).

## Exceptions

* `PROTOCOL_TLS` and `PROTOCOL_SSLv23` negotiate the highest protocol version
both the client and server support. This means that the secure
`PROTOCOL_TLSv1_2` may be chosen, or the insecure `PROTOCOL_SSLv3` may be
chosen. This negotiation is prone to [downgrade attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Downgrade_attack),
and leaves room for insecure connections, so we should prefer explicitly
allowing only secure protocols. These attributes may be a false positive under
certain circumstances, however we should err on the side of security.
* There will often be times when using the most secure options will not be
possible. For example, the server you're communicating with does not support
modern protocols and is not under your control. Further, there can be network
middleware (proxies, etc) that does not support the most secure options. In
these situations the challenges may not be completely technical ones and you
may have to fallback on insecure (or at least not *the most* secure) options -
here you'll have to use your best judgement.
* Connections to local development services or in test environments.
