# DUO135

This linter searches for insecure use of the `defusedxml` module. This module
provides defenses against common XML attack vectors and thus should be as
locked down as possible.

## Problematic code

```python
from defusedxml.lxml import parse
from defusedxml.ElementTree import fromstring
from defusedxml.cElementTree import iterparse

parse("<xml>...</xml>")
fromstring("<xml>...</xml>", forbid_entities=False)
iterparse("<xml>...</xml>", forbid_external=False)
```

## Correct code

```python
from defusedxml.lxml import parse
from defusedxml.ElementTree import fromstring
from defusedxml.cElementTree import iterparse

parse("<xml>...</xml>", forbid_dtd=True)
fromstring("<xml>...</xml>", forbid_dtd=True)
iterparse("<xml>...</xml>", forbid_dtd=True)
```

Note that `forbid_external` and `forbid_entities` default to `True`, but can
be manually specified as such to ensure secure behavior.

## Rationale

These keyword arguments prevent various XML attack vectors. More specifically,
they prevent DTD retrieval, excessive entity expansion, and external and local
file entity expansion.

For more information on these and other attack vectors see the [defusedxml docs](https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/).

## Exceptions

* Situations where the above attack vectors are explicitly required XML
functionality for the program to function correctly.
