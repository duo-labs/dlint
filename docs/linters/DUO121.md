# DUO121

This linter searches for use of the `tempfile.mktemp` function. This function
may introduce race conditions into your code which could negatively impact
security.

From the documentation:

> Use of this function may introduce a security hole in your program. By
> the time you get around to doing anything with the file name it
> returns, someone else may have beaten you to the punch. `mktemp()` usage
> can be replaced easily with `NamedTemporaryFile()`, passing it the
> `delete=False` parameter.

## Problematic code

```python
import tempfile

temp_filename = tempfile.mktemp()
```

## Correct code

```python
import tempfile

fd = tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile(delete=False)
temp_filename = fd.name
```

## Rationale

This function introduces a race condition between filename creation time and
file access time. Depending on the code using the created filename, there could
be security implications. For example, denial-of-service (DoS) and
time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTOU) bugs. Consider a situation where a file
created using this function did not exist, but by the time the filename is used
the file exists. Code that tries to create a new file at this location could
crash and lead to a DoS.

## Exceptions

None
