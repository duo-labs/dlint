# DUO104

This linter searches for use of the built-in `eval` function. This function
commonly allows for arbitrary code execution bugs when combined with user
input.

## Problematic code

```python
malicious_user_input = 'open("/etc/passwd")'
eval(malicious_user_input)
```

## Correct code

```python
# Constant argument
eval('2 + 2')
```

## Rationale

Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the
context of the system the bug is found. E.g. open a reverse shell to a system
of their choosing, install malware by downloading and running a payload,
silently log actions performed on the victim system, etc.

Arbitrary code execution bugs are effectively the keys to the castle. We'd
like to avoid using the above function because it commonly allows for these
types of bugs.

## Exceptions

* Code may be safe if data passed to `eval` contains no user input
* Code may be safe if data passed to `eval` is a constant string
