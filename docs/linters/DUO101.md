# DUO101

**Note: This rule only applies to Python < 3.3**

This linter looks for `inlineCallbacks` functions that have non-empty
`return` statements. Using a non-empty `return` statement and a `yield`
statement in the same function is a syntax error.

This is **not a security bug**, but is a common bug when building `twisted`
applications.

## Problematic code

```python
from twisted.internet import defer

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def func(arg):
	return arg
```

## Correct code

```python
from twisted.internet import defer

@defer.inlineCallbacks
def func(arg):
	defer.returnValue(arg)
```

## Rationale

For more information see [Introduction to Deferreds](https://twisted.readthedocs.io/en/latest/core/howto/defer-intro.html).

## Exceptions

* If you are using Python 3.3+, it is possible to use the `return` statement instead of `returnValue`
