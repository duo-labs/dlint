# DUO118

This linter looks for use of the `gl` module`.

From the documentation:

> Some illegal calls to the GL library cause the Python interpreter to
> dump core. In particular, the use of most GL calls is unsafe before the
> first window is opened.

## Problematic code

```python
import gl
```

## Correct code

None

## Rationale

Crashes can lead to insecure behavior so we should avoid this module.

## Exceptions

None
