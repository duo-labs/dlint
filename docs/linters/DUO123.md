# DUO123

This linter looks for unsafe use of the Python `requests` library.

This library has become the de facto standard for making HTTP requests. This
linter specifically searches for situations where HTTPS requests are made with
SSL certificate verification turned off via the `verify=False` keyword argument.

## Problematic code

```python
import requests

request = requests.get("https://google.com", verify=False)
```

## Correct code

```python
import requests

request = requests.get("https://google.com")
```

## Rationale

HTTPS certificate verification ensures your requests are communicating with
whom they're supposed to be. Without this there could be an attacker
impersonating the server you intend to be communicating with. To prevent this
you must ensure certification verification is enabled.

## Exceptions

* Code connecting to internal network services (although these should strive for full HTTPS as well)
* Code connecting to local development services or in test environments
