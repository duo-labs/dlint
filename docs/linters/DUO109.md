# DUO109

This linter searches for insecure use of the `yaml` module. Its parsing
functions `dump`, `dump_all`, `load`, and `load_all` allow for arbitrary code
execution. Thus, they should be avoided in favor of their safe equivalents:
`safe_dump`, `safe_dump_all`, `safe_load`, and `safe_load_all`.

## Problematic code

```python
import yaml

malicious_user_input = "your_files: !!python/object/apply:subprocess.check_output ['ls']"
yaml.load(malicious_user_input)
```

## Correct code

```python
import yaml

malicious_user_input = "your_files: !!python/object/apply:subprocess.check_output ['ls']"
yaml.safe_load(malicious_user_input)
```

## Rationale

Arbitrary code execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the
context of the system the bug is found. E.g. open a reverse shell to a system
of their choosing, install malware by downloading and running a payload,
silently log actions performed on the victim system, etc.

Arbitrary code execution bugs are effectively the keys to the castle. We'd
like to avoid using the above function because it commonly allows for these
types of bugs.
